The [MyHDL discourse forum](http://discourse.myhdl.org/) is used to
exchange information about MyHDL.  Beginner and advanced discussions
are welcomed on the forum.  The forum, for all
practical purposes, has replaced the mailing-list.  For more iformation
on the mailing-list see below.

In addition to the forum there is an active
[gitter channel](https://gitter.im/myhdl/myhdl)
and a [#myhdl](https://webchat.freenode.net/) IRC channel
on [freenode](https://freenode.net/)

[The MyHDL Mailing List](https://sourceforge.net/p/myhdl/mailman) was
used heavily in the past but has been primarily replaced by the
[discourse forum](http://discourse.myhdl.org/) and
[gitter channel](https://gitter.im/myhdl/myhdl).

The mailing list is archived on <http://gmane.org>, which
provides a bidirectional gateway to the mailing list. Gmane
lets you choose among a variety of interfaces to
access and search the mailing list information. Moreover,
there is no need to subscribe.

All interface options are described here:
<http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.myhdl>.

In particular, to access the list as a usenet newsgroup, you
can use this link:
